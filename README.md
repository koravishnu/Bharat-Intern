For this internship, I was told to perform two tasks.
Task 01: Stock Price Prediction using LSTM. LSTM has the capability of storing ast information abd hence is very useful in predicting stock prices.
This is because the prediction of a stock price is dependent on the previous prices. I have used yFinance to obtain the stock prices of microsoft company over the last 5 years.yFinance is an open source Python library that allows us to acquire stock data from Yahoo Finance without any cost.
Task 02: Titanic Survival Prediction. This project is used to predict whether a passenger will survive on the titanic or not. In additional to that I found accuracy score for the data for easy uderstanding og survival of passengers in the titanic. I have used Kaggle to obtain data for doing this task. 
I have done some Data Analysis and Data Visualizationto the data provided , where we got to know that women are most likely to survive than men. Even people in 3rd class had less chance of survival.
